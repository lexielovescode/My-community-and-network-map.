								<h2>What is my project</h2>
								<p>When we talk about networks and communities, all we think about is a lot of complicated net formation. After a few days of thinking and designing, I decided to use the star sytem to demonstrate my networks and communities. 
                  <br><br>From the center to the outside, it demonstrates my growing process from a little girl to a graduate student. The different sizes of the planets in certain level represent the influence of the networks or communities to my life. When you put your mouse on the list in the left side, you can see the details of these networks and communities and how they influence my professional and personal life.</p>

          <h2 id="me">Jianchun</h2>

          <p>In the center of the system, it is me, Jianchun. The planets around me demonstrated my networks and circles. The color of a certain planet means different networks and communities. The size of the planet means the effect degree of the certain planet to my life and professional goals. </p>
        </li>

          <h2 id="ps">Elementary School</h2>

          <p>The little olive planet means my elementary school. It was in my home town. Even though, I lost contact with most of my classmates. I did have a lovely time in the school. </p>

        <li>
          <h2 id="ms">Middle School</h2>

          <p>My middle school was Nantong Middle School (Yes, that is purple planet). I met several best friends there. As you can see, the little purple planet in orbit around the bigger purple one means them. We support each other no matter where we are.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <h2 id="hs">High School</h2>

            <br>
            <br>And the little brown satellite means a bunch of my classmates. We are still very close. </p>

          <h2 id="nju">Nanjing University</h2>

          <p>I studied hisotry in Nanjing University (NJU). When I was in the last year of my undergraudte, I took an internship as a journalist in Jiangsu Broadcasting Corportation. That is the first time I set foot in the area of media. Furtheremore, I felt it is so interesting and exciting to write news stories about people.
            <br>
            <br> The bigger orange planet orbiting around the NJU planet represents my close friends in the university. They helped me when I was confusing about my life.
            <br>
            <br> The smaller orange planet orbiting around the NJU planet represents a communitiy named Ziteng Society. I was the president of the society. In the society, I editted the magazine named Ziteng. That is the first time, I was a leader of a community.

          <p>The big blue planet with two satellites represents my life in London School of Economics (LSE). I achieved strong abilities in analysis and report writing
            <br>
            <br> The bigger satellite means my close friends in LSE. It is important to have someone understand you when you are pursuing your ideal career. To me, it is UI development.
            <br>
            <br> The smaller satellite means my classmates in my program. I learnt how to communicate with people with different culture backgrounds.

        </li>
        <li>

          <h2 id="jsbc">Jiangsu Broadcasting Corportation</h2>

          <p>This is the company I got my first internship and my first offical job.
            <br> When I worked as a digital media editor, I started to learn about UI, UX, and front-end development etc.. I realized that I finally found the thing that I love. I want to learn more about UI, UX, and front-end development. That is why I went to UW and became a member of Cohort 15.
            <br>
            <br> The larger red satellite means my collegues in digital media center. I learnt a lot from them.
            <br>

            <br> I started my new adventure in Seattle with a lot of new friends.
            <br>
            <br> The biggest green satellite means <b>Cohort 15</b>! They are all fabluous. I learnt a lot from them even just in 2 months.
            <br>

            <br>

          <p>The light green planet sharing the orbit with UW represents my friends in U.S. Before I went to U.S, I have had friends here (I know I am so <em>lucky</em>). Thanks to them, I adapted to the change of my life quickly.</p>
